<h2>Info:</h2>
<p><b>Title: </b>A* Algorithm</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>In this program, the user can choose between an eight tile or fifteen tile board. They can input the start and goal state for the board, and the algorithm will calculate the best path to the end state. The program will then print the path from the start state to the end state.</p>
