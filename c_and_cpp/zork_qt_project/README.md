<h2>Info:</h2>
<p><b>Title: </b>Zork & Qt Project</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>This Qt UI application is based off the game Zork. My lecturer supplied Zork's source code, and my task involved integrating it into a Qt UI and creating my own Zork game. In this game, the player is the Mayo Football Team and they must traverse through the counties of Ireland to find the Sam Maguire cup before time runs out.</p>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<p>(I just wanted to upload it as a display of my C++ programming skills.)</p>
<p>Details of the game's various functions can be found in readme.txt</p>
